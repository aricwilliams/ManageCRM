# ManageCRM

Name = Cuttin' Grass NC
This is an API & UI project that I will build... I plan to put 1k hours into this project over the years. This will be used as a real project to show what i can do. After building the base things I will gain users for this application. Database will be with Azure or my SQL A2 hosting reseller account...






























May the force be with you.
